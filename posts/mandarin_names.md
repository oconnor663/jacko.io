# Putting Some Effort into Pronouncing Chinese (Pinyin) Names

In Mainland China they use the pinyin system to write Mandarin words or names
with English letters. This system wasn't designed to be intuitive for English
speakers, and it's common for our first guess to be so far off the mark that a
listener might not even recognize their own name. If you find yourself in this
situation frequently, and you aren't realistically going to study Chinese as a
language, you can still do far better than average with an hour or so of
effort. Here's what I think are the most bang-for-your-buck rules you can
memorize:

## Consonants

"Zh" sounds like "j", both as in "jump" (not "genre"). The city of Beijing is
pronounced _bay-jing_, and the city of Guangzhou is pronounced _gwang-jo_.

"Q" sounds like "ch". The Qing dynasty is pronounced _ching_.

"X" sounds like "sh". Chinese President Xi Jinping is pronounced _shee
jeen-ping_. The Xia dynasty is pronounced _sha_.

"C" sounds like _ts_, as in "hats" or "pizza". Three-Body Problem author Liu
Cixin is pronounced _lee-oh tsuh-sheen_.

## "I" vowels

Most "i" vowels sound like _ee_. This includes all three in Xi Jinping's name,
and arguably also both in Beijing.

There are exactly three letter pairs where "i" sounds like _uh_: "zi", "ci",
and "si". We saw one of these above in Liu Cixin's given name, _tsuh-sheen_.

There are exactly four letter pairs where "i" sounds like _ur_: "zhi", "chi",
"shi", and "ri". Remember that "zh" sounds like "j", so "zhi" sounds like the
first half of "jury".

Finally, when "i" comes after "u" it sounds like _ay_. The Sui dynasty is
pronounced _sway_.
