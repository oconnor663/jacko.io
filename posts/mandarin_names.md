# So you need to pronounce Mandarin Chinese names?

too difficult

- tones
- the zh/j, ch/q, or sh/x distinctions
- the u/ü distinction
- the \[si] vowel
- the \[r] consonant

worth it:

- zh, q, and x
    - and the j hyperforeignism
    - examples: Xi Jinping, Qin dynasty, Guangzhou, Zhou dynasty
- c and z consonants
    - examples: Tsai Ing-wen (Cài Yīngwén), Mao Zedong, Zhang Ziyi, Empress Dowager Cixi, Liu Cixin
- i and e vowels
    - "e" class: e, ke, se, te, che...
        - examples: Mao Zedong, Chang'e Project
    - "ye" class: ye (only)
        - Beijing? Other "ie" names?
    - "en" class: en, gen, fen, wen
        - Chengdu, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping
    - "yi" class: yi, li, mi, pi, (jian)
        - Beijing
    - "si" class: zi, ci, si
        - Sichuan, Zhang Ziyi, Cixi
    - "chi" class: zhi, chi, shi, ri
        - Shijiazhuang
    - "ui" class: shui, dui
        - Sui dynasty

marginal:

- different \[a] sounds (shan vs shang vs xian, chuan vs juan)
    - "dentist a": shan, ai, shang, mama
    - "pen a": tian, juan/quan/xuan
    - Tian Gong
- different \[o] sounds (bo vs kong)
- different \[u] sounds
    - "iu" class: jiu (baijiu), liu, Liu Cixin


\[e] words
- could
- foot
- sugar

examples:
- Xi Jinping, Deng Xiaoping, Mao Zedong, Cài Yīngwén
- Zhang Ziyi
- Qin Shi Huang
- Sichuan and Xinjiang provinces
- Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities
- Tiangong space station


- When "e" shows up next to an "i" or a "y", your normal instinct to
  pronounce "e" as _eh_ will do fine. But when it shows up by itself or
  before an "n", pronounce it _uh_ instead.
- When "i" 
- When "u"
- "A" is usually the dentist vowel, _ahh_.

## Consonants

If you only have 15 minutes, memorize the best English approximations for these
four consonants. They are completely un-guessable otherwise, so this is the
best bang-for-your-buck in terms of effort.

"Zh" sounds like "j", both as in "jump" (not "genre"). The city of Beijing is
pronounced _bay-jing_, and the city of Guangzhou is pronounced _gwang-jo_.

"Q" sounds like "ch". The Qing dynasty is pronounced _ching_.

"X" sounds like "sh". President Xi Jinping is pronounced _shee jeen-ping_.

"C" sounds like _ts_, as in "hats" or "pizza". Three-Body Problem author Liu
Cixin is pronounced _lee-oh tsuh-sheen_.

## "I" vowels

The most troublesome vowel is "i", because there are several different versions
of it.

Most "i" vowels sound like _ee_. This includes all three in Xi Jinping's name,
and arguably also both in Beijing.

There are exactly three letter pairs where "i" sounds like _uh_: "zi", "ci",
and "si". We saw one of these above in Liu Cixin's given name, _tsuh-sheen_.

There are exactly four letter pairs where "i" sounds like _ur_: "zhi", "chi",
"shi", and "ri". Recall that "zh" sounds like "j", so "zhi" sounds like the
first half of "jury".

Finally, when "i" comes after "u" it sounds like _ay_. The Sui dynasty is
pronounced _sway_.
