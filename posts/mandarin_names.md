# Pronouncing Mandarin Chinese Names

Mainland China uses the pinyin system to spell Mandarin words and names with
English letters.[^exceptions] Pinyin wasn't designed to be intuitive for
English speakers, and it's common for our first guess to be so far off the mark
that a listener can't recognize their own name. But an hour or so of effort is
enough for most English speakers to pronounce Mandarin names
poorly-but-not-incomprehensibly, similar to how we try our best with French or
Russian. Here's what I think are the bare minimum rules you need to memorize to
get there:

[^exceptions]: Pinyin isn't used in Cantonese or other Chinese dialects, and
    it's not as widely used in Taiwanese Mandarin. China officially adopted
    pinyin in 1958, so earlier emigrants also spelled their names differently.

## Consonants

"Zh" sounds like "j", both as in "jump" (not "genre").[^differences] The city
of Beijing is _bay&#8288;-&#8288;jing_, and the city of Guangzhou is
_gwahng&#8288;-&#8288;jo_.

[^differences]: "Zh" and "j" are different in Mandarin, and the English "j"
    isn't quite right for either of them, but it's the closest sound we have.
    The same is true of "ch"/"q" and "sh"/"x" below.

"Q" sounds like "ch". The Qing dynasty is pronounced _ching_.

"X" sounds like "sh". President Xi Jinping is _shee jeen&#8288;-&#8288;ping_.
The Xia dynasty is pronounced _shah_.

"C" sounds like _ts_, as in "hats" or "pizza". Three-Body Problem author Liu
Cixin is _lee&#8288;-&#8288;oh tsuh&#8288;-&#8288;sheen_.

## "I" vowels

Most "i" vowels sound like _ee_, including all the vowels in Xi Jinping's name.

There are exactly three letter pairs where "i" sounds like _uh_: "zi", "ci",
and "si".[^lucy] Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon actress Zhang Ziyi is _jahng
zuh&#8288;-&#8288;yee_. The province of Sichuan is
_suh&#8288;-&#8288;chwahn_.[^szechuan] We also saw Liu Cixin above.

[^lucy]: _Uh_ is a poor approximation of this "i", but it's far better than
    _ee_. The closest sound that's remotely familiar to Americans is [Lucille
    Ball's trademark "eugh"][lucy].

[^szechuan]: "Szechuan" and similar spellings predate the pinyin system.

There are exactly four letter pairs where "i" sounds like _ur_: "zhi", "chi",
"shi", and "ri". The website Zhihu, the Chinese equivalent of Quora, is
_jur&#8288;-&#8288;hoo_.

Finally, when "i" comes after "u" it sounds like _ay_. The Sui dynasty is
pronounced _sway_.
