//! This is an async version of the "basketballs" demo, showing that task switching is much more
//! efficient than thread switching. Make sure you read and understand the non-async version of
//! this demo first. This async version is going to use a lot of concepts we haven't explained yet,
//! so it's ok if the details don't make sense. The high-level structure is the same.
